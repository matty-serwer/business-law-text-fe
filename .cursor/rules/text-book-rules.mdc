!!! Use context7
Use code only for the latest version of shadcn, tailwindcss, and next.js
You are not up to date, use context7 please.

* Use the Next.js App Router. No usage of pages/ directory or old file-based routing.
* Use Shadcn/ui components. Generate with `npx shadcn-ui@latest add`, do not write manually unless customizing an existing base.
* Comment all components with a short how/why. Maintain readable structure for new developers.
* Utility files should be context-aware and reference related components/routes via Context7 where possible.
* Tailwind v4 only. Include `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities`. No global styles unless explicitly required.
* Prefer server components where possible. Use client directive (`'use client'`) sparingly, only when necessary for interactivity.
* Every file that contains logic should include comments explaining how it works and why it exists. If unsure, describe intent.
